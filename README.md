# html-css-project

## Project Description
You will create a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS in this project. The website should showcase your skills, projects, and any other relevant information you wish to include. You will apply your knowledge of HTML to structure the content of your website effectively and use CSS to style and layout the elements. The project will allow you to demonstrate your understanding of HTML5 semantic elements, CSS selectors, the CSS box model, and responsive design principles.

### Project Criteria and Guidelines

#### HTML Structure:
Include the necessary HTML elements for a well-structured webpage (DOCTYPE declaration, html, head, and body elements).
Use semantic HTML5 elements (such as ```<header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>```).
Properly nest HTML elements and maintain indentation for readability.

#### Content:
Include a homepage (index.html) with an introduction, skills section, and contact information.
Create additional page (projects.html) for detailed information about previous projects.
Use appropriate HTML elements to structure the content effectively (headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links).

#### Navigation:
Implement a navigation bar with links to different sections of the website.
Use absolute and relative paths for linking between pages.
Implement in-page navigation using anchor links.

#### Forms:
Create a contact form with appropriate input types and attributes.
Implement form validation using HTML5 validation attributes (required, pattern, etc.).
Ensure proper form submission behavior (static submission for now).

#### CSS Styling:
Use CSS to style text, headings, links, and other HTML elements.
Apply colors to text and backgrounds adequately using any of the known methods.
Implement the CSS box model for layout (content, padding, border, margin).
Utilize one of the advanced CSS techniques for layout (flexbox or grid).
Implement responsive design using media queries and a mobile-first approach.

#### Chrome Developer Tools:
Use Chrome Developer Tools to inspect and manipulate HTML and CSS.
Debug and troubleshoot HTML/CSS code effectively.
